# Multi-turn Agent Dialogue System

This tutorial will guide you on how to build a multi-turn dialogue system using [LazyLLM](https://github.com/LazyLLM/LazyLLM), where two agents (e.g., "Stock Trader" and "Python Programmer") collaborate to complete a specific task. The system supports task specification, role-playing, memory retention, and tool usage.

    - How to use `OnlineChatModule` to simulate role styles by adjusting model temperature.
    - How to implement agent role-playing and task-driven behavior using custom prompts.
    - How to use the utility function `get_history` for maintaining dialogue memory.
    - How to use the [ReactAgent][lazyllm.tools.agent.ReactAgent] to build agents with role directives and problem-solving capabilities.
    - How to build a multi-turn dialogue system with task completion detection.

## Project Dependencies

Install `lazyllm`:

```bash
pip install lazyllm
```

Import the relevant packages:

```python
from lazyllm import OnlineChatModule
from lazyllm.tools import fc_register, ReactAgent
from typing import List, Dict

from lazyllm.module.llms.onlinemodule.base.onlineChatModuleBase import StaticParams
```

## Feature Overview

* Supports **multi-agent role-playing and alternating instruction execution**, simulating realistic collaboration
* Introduces a **dialogue memory mechanism**, using utility functions to retrieve historical context
* Enables tool usage via `ReactAgent` for automatic selection and execution
* Uses high- and low-temperature models to simulate **creative generation vs. stable execution styles**
* Allows task completion signaling via `<CAMEL_TASK_DONE>`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Utility Functions

We first define a simple dialogue history cache and a tool function `get_history` that agents can use to retrieve recent conversation history.

```python
CHAT_HISTORY: Dict[str, List[str]] = {}

def add_to_history(session_id: str, message: str) -> str:
    '''
    Add a message to the conversation history for a specific session.

    Args:
        session_id (str): Unique identifier for the session.
        message (str): The message content to add.

    Returns:
        str: Confirmation message indicating success.
    '''
    if session_id not in CHAT_HISTORY:
        CHAT_HISTORY[session_id] = []
    CHAT_HISTORY[session_id].append(message)
    return f"Message added to session '{session_id}'."

@fc_register("tool")
def get_history(session_id: str, limit: int = 5) -> str:
    '''
    Retrieve the most recent messages from the conversation history.

    Args:
        session_id (str): Unique identifier for the session.
        limit (int, optional): Number of recent messages to retrieve. Defaults to 5.

    Returns:
        str: Concatenated string of recent messages, or notice if empty.
    '''
    history = CHAT_HISTORY.get(session_id, [])
    if not history:
        return "No history found for this session."
    return "\n".join(history[-limit:])
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tool functions are registered using the `@fc_register("tool")` decorator, allowing agents to invoke them during conversations.

### Step 2: Initialize Language Models

We use two language model instances with different temperature settings to simulate a creative (high temperature) and stable (low temperature) dialogue style.

```python
temp_high = StaticParams(temperature=1.0)
temp_low = StaticParams(temperature=0.2)
llm_temp_high = OnlineChatModule(static_params=temp_high)
llm_temp_low = OnlineChatModule(static_params=temp_low)
```

### Step 3: Task Specification (Make the Task More Concrete)

We start with an initial task and use the high-temperature model to rewrite it into a more specific, actionable subtask.

```python
task = "Develop a trading bot for the stock market"
word_limit = 50

rewrite_prompt = f"""
You can make a task more specific.
Here is a task that Python Programmer will help Stock Trader to complete: {task}.
Please make it more specific. Be creative and imaginative.
Please reply with the specified task in {word_limit} words or less. Do not add anything else.
"""

specified_task = llm_temp_high(rewrite_prompt)
print("ðŸŽ¯ Specified Task:\n", specified_task)
```

### Step 4: Define Role Prompts (System Prompts)

We define two system prompts to constrain the user and assistant behaviors. Prompts include task information, interaction formats, and behavioral rules.

```python
assistant_role = "Python Programmer"
user_role = "Stock Trader"
```

#### User System Prompt

The user gives clear instructions to the assistant using the following format:

```python
user_sys_prompt = f"""
Never forget you are a {user_role} and I am a {assistant_role}. Never flip roles! You will always instruct me.
We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task.
I must help you to complete the task.
Here is the task: {specified_task}. Never forget our task!
You must instruct me based on my expertise and your needs to complete the task ONLY in the following two ways:

1. Instruct with a necessary input:
Instruction: <YOUR_INSTRUCTION>
Input: <YOUR_INPUT>

2. Instruct without any input:
Instruction: <YOUR_INSTRUCTION>
Input: None

The "Instruction" describes a task or question. The paired "Input" provides further context or information for the requested "Instruction".

You must give me one instruction at a time.
I must write a response that appropriately completes the requested instruction.
I must decline your instruction honestly if I cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or my capability and explain the reasons.
You should instruct me, not ask me questions.
Now you must start to instruct me using the two ways described above.
Do not add anything else other than your instruction and the optional corresponding input!
Keep giving me instructions and necessary inputs until you think the task is completed.
When the task is completed, you must only reply with a single word <CAMEL_TASK_DONE>.
Never say <CAMEL_TASK_DONE> unless my responses have solved your task.
"""
```

#### Assistant System Prompt

The assistant responds to user instructions with complete solutions, always beginning the response like this:

```python
assistant_sys_prompt = f"""
Never forget you are a {assistant_role} and I am a {user_role}. Never flip roles! Never instruct me!
We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task.
You must help me to complete the task.
Here is the task: {specified_task}. Never forget our task!
I must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

I must give you one instruction at a time.
You must write a specific solution that appropriately completes the requested instruction.
You must decline my instruction honestly if you cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or your capability and explain the reasons.
Do not add anything else other than your solution to my instruction.
You are never supposed to ask me any questions; you only answer questions.
You are never supposed to reply with a flake solution. Explain your solutions.
Your solution must be declarative sentences and simple present tense.
Unless I say the task is completed, you should always start with:

Solution: <YOUR_SOLUTION>

<YOUR_SOLUTION> should be specific and provide preferable implementations and examples for task-solving.
Always end <YOUR_SOLUTION> with: Next request.

You can use the tool `get_history` to retrieve recent conversation history if needed.
To use it, call: get_history(session_id="session_1").
"""
```

> ðŸ“Œ The prompt also explains how to use tools like `get_history(session_id="session_1")`.

### Step 5: Initialize Agents

We use `ReactAgent` to create agents, each with its own LLM, system prompt, and available tool list.

```python
from lazyllm.tools import ReactAgent

tools = ['get_history']

user_agent = ReactAgent(llm=llm_temp_low, tools=tools, return_trace=True, prompt=user_sys_prompt)
assistant_agent = ReactAgent(llm=llm_temp_low, tools=tools, return_trace=True, prompt=assistant_sys_prompt)
```

### Step 6: Begin Dialogue and Save History

The assistant starts the dialogue by prompting the user, who responds with the first instruction. Both sidesâ€™ messages are saved to history.

```python
assistant_msg = f"{user_sys_prompt} Now start to give me instructions one by one. Only reply with Instruction and Input."
user_msg = f"{assistant_sys_prompt}"

instruction = user_agent(assistant_msg)
print(f"\nðŸ‘¤ {user_role}:\n\n{instruction}\n")
solution = assistant_agent(instruction)
print(f"\nðŸ¤– {assistant_role}:\n\n{solution}\n")

session_id = "session_1"
add_to_history(session_id, f"{user_role}: {instruction}")
add_to_history(session_id, f"{assistant_role}: {solution}")")
```

### Step 7: Start Multi-turn Dialogue Loop

The agents continue interacting until the task is marked complete.

```python
max_turns = 5
n = 0

while n < max_turns:
    n += 1

    # user_agent generates instruction
    instruction = user_agent(assistant_msg)
    print(f"\nðŸ‘¤ {user_role}:\n\n{instruction}\n")
    add_to_history(session_id, f"{user_role}: {instruction}")

    if "<CAMEL_TASK_DONE>" in instruction:
        break

    # assistant_agent generates solution
    solution = assistant_agent(instruction)
    print(f"\nðŸ¤– {assistant_role}:\n\n{solution}\n")
    add_to_history(session_id, f"{assistant_role}: {solution}")

    assistant_msg = solution
```

```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self, fast_ema_period, slow_ema_period, signal_period, api_url):
        self.fast_ema_period = fast_ema_period
        self.slow_ema_period = slow_ema_period
        self.signal_period = signal_period
        self.api_url = api_url

    def get_macd_parameters(self):
        return {
            "fast_ema_period": self.fast_ema_period,
            "slow_ema_period": self.slow_ema_period,
            "signal_period": self.signal_period
        }

    def get_api_url(self):
