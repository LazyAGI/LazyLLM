### Building Complex Applications

### Building Applications Based on Internal Tools

> **Note**:
>
> Although it appears to be composed of modules combined into a data flow and then started uniformly, we are not a "static graph". The main manifestations are:
> - We use basic Python syntax to build applications, and the usage is very close to traditional programming methods.
> - You can still take advantage of Python's powerful and flexible features to change the topology of an already built application during runtime, and subsequent execution will follow the modified structure.
> - You can flexibly inject hook functions you wish to execute at the connection points of the modules. These functions can even be defined at runtime.
