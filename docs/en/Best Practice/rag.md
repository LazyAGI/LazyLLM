## RAG

Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge technology in the realm of large models. Its working principle involves first retrieving relevant information from a vast document collection when the model needs to generate text or answer questions. This retrieved information is then used to guide the generation process, significantly enhancing the quality and accuracy of the generated text. Through this method, RAG can provide more precise and meaningful responses when dealing with complex issues, representing a significant advancement in natural language processing. The superiority of this approach lies in its combination of retrieval and generation advantages, enabling the model to not only generate fluent text but also offer evidence-based answers grounded in real data.
This article demonstrates how to build your own RAG application using LazyLLM and how to flexibly add recall strategies.
